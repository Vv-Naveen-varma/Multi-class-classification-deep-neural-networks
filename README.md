# Multiclass Classification using Deep NeuralÂ Networks

We are going to discuss Multi-Class classification topics used in deep neural networks and how to implement them. 
> Topics used in this Repo are Softmax function, Multiclass Cross entropy and multi-class model, neural network model
> To get a breif overview of these topics above, take a look at [medium](https://naveen-varma.medium.com/multiclass-classification-using-deep-neural-networks-p-3-d2432cc568c9)

## Code Excecution:
1. Download the Multi_class_classification_neural_networks.ipynb file from this repo.
2. Install jupyter Notebook through anaconda installer.
3. Install all required Libraries like Tensorflow, keras, Matplotlib.
4. That's it you are good to go. Open jupyter notebook and run all cells and check out the implementation.

### Remainder:
Note that all neural networks are referred as Artificial Neural Networks(ANN). The neural networks with more than one hidden layer are called Deep Neural Networks(DNN). Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) are mainly used in image processing.
